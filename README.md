# Pry [![Travis-CI](https://api.travis-ci.org/ostera/pry.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ostera/pry)
> Watch your application spawn an unfold right in front of you ðŸ”­

As of right now, `pry` is just a very simple application that will trace and store all of
`erlang:spawn` and `erlang:spawn_link` calls being made for any non-standard Erlang module.

Have a look at `pry_blacklist` to see exactly what's being ignored.

## Tutorial

```erlang
Eshell V7.3  (abort with ^G)
1> application:start(pry).
ok
2> pry:add_publisher(self()).
ok
3> application:start(schrodinger).
ok
4> flush().

## Event format


```erlang
#{
  % Raw Process information
  info => [{current_function,{pry,dummy,1}}, ..],

  % Quick access to the MFA this process was spawned with
  mfa => {pry,dummy,1},

  % Pid of the parent
  parent => <0.77.0>,

  % Pid of this process
  self => <0.79.0>,

  % Timestamp when the tracer sent this process for tracking
  timestamp => {1465,43729,784546}
}
```
