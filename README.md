# Pry [![Travis-CI](https://api.travis-ci.org/ostera/pry.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ostera/pry)
> ðŸ”­ An Erlang application for observing supervision trees

As of right now, `pry` is just a very simple application that will trace and store all of
`erlang:spawn` and `erlang:spawn_link` calls being made for any non-standard Erlang module.

Have a look at `pry_blacklist` to see exactly what's being ignored.

## Installation

Simply include in your `rebar.config` as:

```erlang
{deps, [
  % ...
  {pry, {git, "https://github.com/ostera/pry", {tag, "0.1.0"}}}
  % ...
]}.
```
## Usage

Include `pry` in your application start up list, before your actual application,
so it'll start tracking everything.

ok
2> pry:add_publisher(self()).
ok

4> flush().

#### Event format


```erlang
#{
  % Raw Process information
  info => [{current_function,{pry,dummy,1}}, ..],

  % Quick access to the MFA this process was spawned with
  mfa => {pry,dummy,1},

  % Pid of the parent
  parent => <0.77.0>,

  % Pid of this process
  self => <0.79.0>,

  % Timestamp when the tracer sent this process for tracking
  timestamp => {1465,43729,784546}
}
```

## Motivation

Inspired by Ruby's [pry](https://github.com/pry/pry), I set forth to make a tool
that would collect, format, and export as much information of the running process
trees as they were being created and destroyed.

The goal of pry is to be a drop-in tool to get a

Fork, make a topic branch, and send a Pull Request. Travis will let you know if
it's good to go, and from the on we can review, retouch, and merge.

Included here is a `Makefile` with handy targets. Run `make` to execute the complete
battery of tests.
